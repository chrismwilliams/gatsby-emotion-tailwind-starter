## Using Emotion & Tailwind

With the CSS utility library Tailwind you can quickly add styles and responsive design, all without having to write any css. Emotion allows you to name and style elements within your js files.

```JSX
/*
  import tw, { styled } from 'twin.macro';

  ** Creating a styled div, centering children via flex-box **
*/

const StyledDiv = styled.div`
  ${tw`flex justify-center items-center`}
`

/*
  ** Or with grid **
*/
const AltStyledDiv = tw.div`grid place-content-center place-items-center`

return (
 <>
    <StyledDiv>
      <p>I'm centred</p>
      <p>Me too!</p>
    </StyledDiv>
    <AltStyledDiv>
      <p>Same here</p>
    </AltStyledDiv>
 </>
);
```

The [tailwind docs](https://tailwindcss.com) are a great resource to get you started. The starter uses [twin.macro](https://github.com/ben-rogerson/twin.macro) which is a fantastic library, and includes many additional variants.

## Customisation

- [Tailwind config](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration). Open up the `tailwind.config.js` file to set your own project preferences & requirements, such as break-points, colours, and fonts.

- A layout component (`src/components/Layout.js`) is used for setting a standardised default layout to wrap pages.

- Dark & Light mode. Open up `src/components/styled/baseStyles.js` and `tailwind.config.js` to see where/how CSS custom variables are added. You can also use Tailwinds' [dark variant](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode#toggling-dark-mode-manually) within styled components, as shown in `src/components/home/styled/card.js` with a dark variant, and `src/components/styled/socialList.js` for a light variant.

- This template uses the plugin [typefaces](https://github.com/KyleAMathews/typefaces/blob/master/README.md) to optimise font delivery. Changing font(s) simply requires installing your favourite typeface-font and importing into `gatsby-browser.js`. Remember to add your font(s) into `tailwind.config.js`, either the fonts sans/serif array, in order to use it with tailwind utilities.

- SEO component, taken from [gatsby-starter-blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog), allowing you to add your SEO descriptions & title's.

- Favicon. Auto-generated from [gatsby-plugin-manifest](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-plugin-manifest#readme) set in `gatsby-config.js`. Replace the current favicon (`src/images/icon/logo.png`) with your own 512x512 icon
